# encodeception


This was very hard almost as hard as the `the room is crowded` one. 

So I did it after the open and I gotta say it gave me some trouble.

The first part was easy no big problem, I did it actually in the first tries using cyberchef

The second part was super tricky.
I tried a bunch of stuff. I was trying to figure out why it looked like a ciphered code and at the same time like a reversed base64,
the only problem with base64 was that it didnt have lowercase letters soooo, it took me some time to finnaly figure out that I should actually separate the groups with 2 numbers and try to decypher them.
I tried a bunch of cyphers well the only one that made the most sense was polybius so I kinda looked at it and then I figured out that I should combine it back and I get the actual base 64 string.
Buttt I was about to give up because I did a buch of stuff wrong and had so many failed attempts, it was actually my fault. It took me some hours to figure out what I actually did wrong in combining the strings.

I don't have all every screeen shot but this is like part of my attempts:

As you can see I combined the string a bunch of times wrong also didnt reverse the stuff before. Well the worst part is that this is just a little bit of all the attempts I had lol. 
If you look closer you can see all the tabs I had open in cyberchef.

For the polybius I tried http://cryptii.com/ because cyberchef doesnt have polybius.

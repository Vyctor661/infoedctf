# Numerical sequence

This one a harder, so my first thought was that those are coordinates and I started putting them in but it didnt make much sense but I knew it was about the coordinates because I think the first 2 were in Romania so it would've been too big of a coincidence to not be about the coordinates.

So there were a bunch of locations.

Playing with it in the notepad I put all the location names each on a new line and I tried to see if there was any connection between them,
and then it just clicked and I saw the first letter of each city.

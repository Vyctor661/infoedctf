# Treasure hunt

This was cool too, after the first day (aka second day), first thing in the morning was start working on ctf, (this was before detective work), so I thought that I cant do detective work so I should start focusing on something else.
And I looked at treasure hunt and I then realized it was super easy.

And I started working in jsfiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/57x6gyoL/1/

I had some failed attempts, first the text was out of the canvas then the text was incomplete and I thought it was something else at first and then I double checked the data and I saw that I introduced the data wrong.
Oh and before rechecking the data I didnt know when to stop the alg and and I made it stop like before everything combined and I added a button to go to next step so I can actually click it until all the pixels come into place  so I wouldnt have to try to read it when it moves.
